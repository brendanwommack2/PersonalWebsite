                    <div>
                        <p>This position entailed four months spent in the Rocky Mountains with a crew of 11 people working on a myriad of conservation projects. We worked with different land management agencies including the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management throughout the Rocky Mountains in remote backcountry locations within the beautiful states of Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Each project lasted between 1 and 4 weeks and ranged from trail construction to habitat rehabilitation. This experience involved spending every moment of every day in the wilderness and cemented in me a lifelong love of the natural world, along with a respect and fervor for the neccesary conservation efforts to preserve it.</p>
