                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a Master’s student at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS), pursuing an M.S. in Geospatial Data Sciences. Alongside my graduate studies, I work part-time as a Research Programmer Specialist with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), where I support projects at the intersection of marine science, geospatial analysis, and environmental data management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science from William & Mary, with a concentration in GIS and spatial data analysis. My academic foundation includes system design, programming (Python, C++, JavaScript), and database management, paired with deep experience in GIS technologies, spatial workflows, and environmental applications through coursework such as Conservation GIS and Geovisualization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional and academic journey has been guided by a passion for the natural world and public service. I’ve contributed to biodiversity research and land cover change analysis at the William & Mary Herbarium, worked on invasive species removal and wetland conservation with the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps, and expanded my geospatial perspective internationally while researching weather patterns for the European Research Council in Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I bring together technical expertise, interdisciplinary problem-solving, and a conservation-driven mindset to advance geospatial science in support of sustainable and community-focused outcomes.

                    <h2>What I Want to Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        I aspire to work at the intersection of software development and geospatial science to design tools and workflows that support conservation, climate adaptation, and sustainable infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My focus is on combining rigorous spatial analysis and thoughtful data management to turn complex environmental datasets into actionable insights, whether through custom geoprocessing tools, decision-support systems, or scalable platforms for environmental planning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, I want my work to bridge technical innovation with real-world impact for both ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.

                    <h2>Why Me?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I bring a rare combination of technical depth, field experience, and mission-driven perspective:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GIS & Software Expertise:</strong> Experienced with ArcGIS Pro, ModelBuilder, Python scripting, and web frameworks like Tornado and Flask. Skilled in managing, cleaning, and visualizing large spatial datasets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Applied Field & Research Experience:</strong> From ecological work in the Rocky Mountains to biodiversity analysis at the William & Mary Herbarium and international climate research with the ERC, I understand the importance of reliable data and thoughtful environmental analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborative & Impact-Focused:</strong> I thrive in interdisciplinary teams and am motivated by public service and environmental stewardship. I aim to build tools that are not only technically strong, but also meaningful and accessible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Employers seeking a geospatial professional with a solid technical background, field-tested problem-solving ability, and a heart for conservation will find in me a dedicated and capable candidate.
