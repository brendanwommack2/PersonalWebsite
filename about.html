                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a recent graduate from The College of William and Mary, I have earned my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science and a concentration in GIS and spatial data analysis. My education has equipped me with a strong technical foundation in system design, programming (Python, C++, JavaScript), and database management, while also deepening my expertise in GIS technologies, spatial data workflows, and environmental applications through coursework like Conservation GIS and Geovisualization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My academic journey has been shaped by a passion for the natural world and public service. I’ve contributed to land cover change analysis and biodiversity research at the William & Mary Herbarium, worked with invasive species removal and wetland conservation through the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps, and expanded my geospatial experience internationally while researching weather patterns for the European Research Council in Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the intersection of liberal arts and technical training, I bring creative problem-solving, interdisciplinary thinking, and adaptability to every project I undertake.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What I Want to Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        I aspire to work at the intersection of software development and GIS, building tools that empower organizations to make informed, data-driven decisions in conservation, urban planning, water management, and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm especially drawn to roles that combine spatial analysis, clean data management, and the development of intuitive, map-based interfaces. Whether through building custom geoprocessing tools, supporting public-facing GIS platforms, or developing sustainable workflows for large datasets, I want to create solutions that make a tangible impact on environmental and community-focused initiatives.

                    <h2>Why Me?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I bring a rare blend of technical expertise, field experience, and a conservationist’s perspective:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GIS & Software Proficiency:</strong> Experienced with ArcGIS Pro, ModelBuilder, Python scripting, and web development frameworks like Tornado and Flask. Skilled in managing, cleaning, and visualizing large spatial datasets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hands-On Field & Research Experience:</strong> From ecological fieldwork in the Rocky Mountains to spatial analysis at the William & Mary Herbarium and international research with the ERC, I understand the importance of high-quality data and thoughtful analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborative & Mission-Driven:</strong> I thrive in team settings and am deeply motivated by public service and environmental stewardship. I want to build tools that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and accessible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Employers seeking a geospatial professional with a solid technical background, field-tested problem-solving ability, and a heart for conservation will find in me a dedicated and capable candidate.
