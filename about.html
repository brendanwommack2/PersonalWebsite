            <div class="experience-content">
                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a senior at William and Mary, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. My education has equipped me with a strong foundation in system design, database management, and machine learning, as well as a rich background in GIS through courses like Conservation GIS and Geovisualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics, I am a passionate conservationist with hands-on experience working in the backcountry and volunteering at William and Mary’s herbarium, where I contributed to critical data management projects. My experiences reflect my commitment to merging my technical expertise with my deep love for the natural world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At William and Mary, the liberal arts tradition has empowered me to approach problems creatively, connect interdisciplinary ideas, and adapt quickly—skills that I bring to every project I undertake.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Want to Do</h2>
                <p>
                    I aspire to work at the intersection of software development and GIS to create tools that empower organizations to make data-driven decisions, especially in areas like conservation, urban planning, and sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I am particularly drawn to GIS-related development, I am open to diverse roles in software engineering and data analysis where I can apply my problem-solving skills and technical expertise. Whether building web-based geospatial applications, designing intuitive user interfaces, or managing large datasets, I thrive on creating impactful solutions that address real-world challenges.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Me?</h2>
                <p>
                    I bring a unique combination of technical skills, real-world experience, and passion:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> My projects have involved building APIs for geospatial data, developing web applications using frameworks like Tornado and Flask, and working with GIS tools to analyze and visualize data effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptability and Collaboration:</strong> Whether integrating into a European research team, collaborating with conservation crews, or volunteering on campus, I excel in dynamic environments that require teamwork and self-direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>A Conservationist’s Perspective:</strong> My background in conservation—from working in remote backcountry locations to managing herbarium datasets—gives me a deep appreciation for the natural world and a unique lens for tackling challenges in GIS and data visualization.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Employers seeking a candidate who can bridge the gap between software development and GIS, with a passion for creating tools that make a difference, will find that I offer a rare and valuable combination of skills and experiences.
