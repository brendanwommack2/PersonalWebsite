                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a Master’s student at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS), pursuing an M.S. in Geospatial Data Sciences. Alongside my graduate studies, I work part-time as a Research Programmer Specialist with the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), where I support projects at the intersection of marine science, geospatial analysis, and environmental data management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science from William & Mary, with a concentration in GIS and spatial data analysis. My academic foundation includes system design, programming (Python, C++, JavaScript), and database management, paired with deep experience in GIS technologies, spatial workflows, and environmental applications through coursework such as Conservation GIS and Geovisualization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional and academic journey has been guided by a passion for the natural world and public service. I’ve contributed to biodiversity research and land cover change analysis at the William & Mary Herbarium, worked on invasive species removal and wetland conservation with the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps, and expanded my geospatial perspective internationally while researching weather patterns for the European Research Council in Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I bring together technical expertise, interdisciplinary problem-solving, and a conservation-driven mindset to advance geospatial science in support of sustainable and community-focused outcomes.

                    <h2>What I Want to Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        I aspire to work at the intersection of software development and geospatial data sciences to design tools and workflows that empower scientists and communities to make informed, data-driven decisions in conservation, climate adaptation, and sustainable resource management. My focus is on combining rigorous spatial analysis and thoughtful data management to turn complex datasets into valuable insights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether through building custom geoprocessing solutions or developing scalable systems for environmental data, I want my work to bridge technical innovation with meaningful impact for both ecosystems and people.

                    <h2>Why Me?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I bring a rare blend of technical expertise, field experience, and a conservationist’s perspective:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GIS & Software Proficiency:</strong> Experienced with ArcGIS Pro, ModelBuilder, Python scripting, and web development frameworks like Tornado and Flask. Skilled in managing, cleaning, and visualizing large spatial datasets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hands-On Field & Research Experience:</strong> From ecological fieldwork in the Rocky Mountains to spatial analysis at the William & Mary Herbarium and international research with the ERC, I understand the importance of high-quality data and thoughtful analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborative & Mission-Driven:</strong> I thrive in team settings and am deeply motivated by public service and environmental stewardship. I want to build tools that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and accessible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Employers seeking a geospatial professional with a solid technical background, field-tested problem-solving ability, and a heart for conservation will find in me a dedicated and capable candidate.
